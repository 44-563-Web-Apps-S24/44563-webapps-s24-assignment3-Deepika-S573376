    <p>Hi, I'm Deepika. One of my favorite books is "Wings of Fire." It's an incredible journey through a fantastical world of dragons and adventure, authored by Tui T. Sutherland. The book explores themes of friendship, courage, and the power of destiny. The intricate plot and well-developed characters make it a must-read for fantasy enthusiasts!</p>
